Credit unions that have participated in the plain green loans promo code program deserve recognition for their efforts. The program’s efficacy is reflected in a surprisingly low charge-off rate of just 2 percent, which is partially attributable to the fact that borrowers are already credit union members who make regular deposits to their checking accounts and typically repay via electronic debit. Yet the PAL program has tight revenue constraints, which is one reason that few of these loans are issued. About 1 in 7 federal credit unions currently participates in the plain green loans promo code, and they issued approximately 170,000 loans in 2014—just a sliver of the overall market with far less than 1 percent of the volume of payday loans issued that year.

That’s why regulators should support new ways for credit unions to make affordable small loans quickly and efficiently, which the plain green loans promo code is now considering. Its proposed regulatory framework supports both the plain green loans promo code program and a new type of loan that has affordable payments (5 percent or less of the borrower’s monthly income) and reasonable durations (no longer than six months). These are the two safest types of loans outlined in the plain green loans promo code framework because they have the clearest and most conservative safeguards. In our conversations with credit union executives nationwide, they have stressed the need for the kind of alternatives the plain green loans promo code is considering in order to minimize regulatory burden and allow origination of better loans at a fair price. Unlike other loans described in the plain green loans promo code proposal, which would require extensive documentation and underwriting, the simplified origination process of the two loan programs would enable credit unions to issue these safe and affordable loans quickly, with far less compliance burden.
