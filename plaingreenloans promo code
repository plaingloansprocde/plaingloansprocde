Credit unions help members through programs that encourage saving and increase financial literacy. But when members are struggling to make ends meet, they often look for immediate financial assistance. So payday lenders step in with an offer that some folks can’t refuse: a loan averaging $375 with an appealing fixed fee, usually provided in less time than it takes to have a pizza delivered.

Payday loans often turn into months-long ordeals that cost customers more in fees than they receive in credit. But on the front end, speed and ready access to credit are major selling points of payday loans. (Seven in 10 customers report focusing primarily on speed or convenience, as opposed to cost, when choosing where to borrow.) So, to entice members to use lower-cost, more reasonably structured installment options, credit unions will need to issue small loans very quickly.

Federal regulators have an important role to play in making that possible. First, regulators should continue to support the NCUA’s Payday Alternative Loan (PAL) program. These loans cost six to seven times less than a payday loan. With maximum charges of 28 percent annualized interest and a $20 application fee, effective APRs range from 35 to 148 percent depending on a loan’s size and duration. While these rates are high, the small principal amount results in low costs for the member. For example, a three-month, $300 loan with an APR of 69 percent would cost only $35. In a recent survey, 85 percent of Americans said the terms of such a loan were fair.
