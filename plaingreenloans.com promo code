In the next few months, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau plaingreenloans.com promo code will propose new payday loan rules that build on the bureau’s March initial framework. The impending rules will provide a much-needed response to many of the widespread harms in the payday loan market, which will benefit credit union members who currently use these loans. But the plaingreenloans.com promo code also should ensure that the new rules help credit unions provide better small-loan alternatives so their members no longer feel the need to go to payday lenders.

More than 100 million payday loans are issued annually, typically at rates between 300 and 500 percent APR. This is a large market that credit unions could serve better than payday lenders do, and at far lower cost to borrowers. Payday lenders require prospective borrowers to have a checking account and income stream. In other words, these borrowers are not the “unbanked.” So why are credit union members and bank customers turning to payday lenders?
